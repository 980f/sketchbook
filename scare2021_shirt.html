    <h2>Burda 6349 shirt, with additions for Scare 2021</h2>
    <p>as of 25Sep2021.</p>
    <p>We vary from the "A" design by having two false pocket flaps instead of one actual pocket. We also add epaulets.<br>
      <br>

    <h3>Layout optimizations</h3>
    Since we are making multiple copies we can minimize waste by doing some of the on-fold pieces not on the usual fold. Note: 'using the fold' is done to get the best symmetry possible without a seam along the line of symmetry.<br>
    <br>
    In all but one case (the back) we need two of the on-fold pieces. For those I have doubled the pattern piece so that they can be cut from the normally folded fabric but not lined up on the fold. <br>
    Cut wide. Take the cut pieces and fold them in half along the line of the original "place on fold" part of the pattern piece. Trim the folded pieces to the original pattern outline.<br>
    <br>
    If the interfacing is iron on then it can be cut without the seam allowances. That allows for easier turning of the pieces, and saves on interfacing and the time to trim it after sewing.<br>
    <br>
    The epaulets and pocket flaps require 4 fabric pieces and 2 interfacing pieces each shirt. I folded scraps into 4 layers for cutting the fabric.

    <h3>Sewing</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>epaulets</li>
      <ol>
        <li>iron on the interfacing to the wrongside of one piece</li>
        <li>sew the 3 pieces together, fabric rightsides touching, the short straight end is left open.</li>
        <li>clip to 1/4" outside the stitching.</li>
        <li>top stitch 3 sides. The 4th side is embedded in the shoulder seam.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>pocket flaps</li>
      <ol>
        <li>sew 3 sides, leave the top edge (straight one) unsewn.&nbsp; </li>
        <li>turn making the points nice and sharp using a bamboo skewer or dull #2 pencil or similar poking stick.</li>
        <li>place outer face (in case one is prettier) against rightside of shirt and flipped up, wavy/bottom edge near the neck/shoulder.</li>
        <li>sew along horizontal line transferred from pattern. It may seem far from the center of the shirt but that edge is rolled twice to make a 1" or so edge 3 layers thick. <br>
          The lines on the original pattern were deemed way too low. The finished top edge should be halfway between the top button, around 4" below the finished collar seam, judge it up towards the collar if eyeballing it.</li>
        <li>fold down into "closed" position and topstitch around all four edges, try to make the points even pointier.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>collar</li>
      <ol>
        <li>sew the two pieces rightsides together on 3 sides, leave open the side that attaches to the shirt (the shorter of the two longer sides)</li>
        <li>trim and turn</li>
        <li>top stitch the 3 sides.</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <li>collar band</li>
      <ol>
        <ol>
        </ol>
        <li>Lay the collar band parts rightside to rightside sandwiching the collar between them. Pinning is probably necessary, definitely so for the Jersey knit fabric.</li>
        <li>After sewing the collar band must have enough materiel beyond the collar on each side for a button hole to be exposed between the collar edges.</li>
        <li>the sewing must stop a seam allowance before the open edge. If you sew past that you will have to rip out a few stitches later.</li>
        <li>clip and turn.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>yoke to back and fronts</li>
      <ol>
        <li>sandwich top of back between yoke pieces, yoke pieces rightside to each side of the back. You will have to pin this as the edges being joined are curved opposite of each other. <br>
          This keeps the shirt from puckering out behind the shoulders, the back of the shirt will take on a curve in this step.</li>
        <li>sew the yokes to the back.</li>
        <li>sew the shirt fronts just to the yoke piece on the rightside of the back, rightsides together.</li>
        <li>open up so that the shirt makes a Y, wrongside up</li>
        <li>fold the other yoke piece, the one that faced the inside of the back, over the other yoke and front piece, folding the edge of the yoke to line up with the seam just sewn.</li>
        <li>topstitch or stitch in ditch to catch the inside yoke to the outside yoke sandwiching the fronts.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>attaching collar</li>
      <ol>
        <li>starting at the center of the neck pin just what will be the outer layer of the collar band to the outside of the back and yokes.</li>
        <li>One approach, before more experience was gained:</li>
        <ol>
          <li>When you get to the center edge of the shirt fronts you fold that center edge twice such that it fits into the collar band. <br>
            THIS IS THE TRICKIEST PART. If you fold the center edge of the fronts according to the pattern it is unlikely to match the collar band. <br>
            Wait until this step then measure from the outside of the collar band to the center edge of each front, then cut that number in half and fold the shirt inside to inside by that amount twice. <br>
            IF the fabric does not have distinct inside and outside then you can do the folds to the outside, I personally prefer that appearance. </li>
          <li>Top stitch the center fronts inside of the edge of the fold, make sure you don't catch the collar band.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>alternative to above:</li>
        <ol>
          <li><strong><em>Before attaching the fronts to the yoke</em></strong> fold the inner/button edge of the fronts twice, first fold is at the cusp around an inch from the opening of the collar. </li>
          <li>Fold that over again and top stitch both edges of the plaquet you just formed.</li>
          <li>When you get to the ends of the collar band pucker it in to match the edge of the front. You may wish to clip some fabric to make the pucker behave nicely.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Stitch the collar band to the shirt body.</li>
        <li>fold the collar up.</li>
        <li>fold the remaining inside of the collar edge of the collar band to the shirt. <br>
          Some people hand baste this edge.<br>
          Some people tuck the raw edge into some bias tape and sew that on "in the gutter".<br>
          I short the seam allowance when sewing the prior step so that I can roll over the edge of the inner part of the collar band then sew in the gutter capturing the rolled edge.<br>
          When even lazier I just top stitch the folded edge down, the collar will cover it.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>attaching sleeves (nothing special other than placing the epaulet)</li>
      <ol>
        <li>I wait to hem sleeves until after I sew them on in case I screw up sewing them on. If you are good at sleeves hemming them now is convenient.</li>
        <li>transfer lines marked "shoulder" from yoke pattern to shirt. For the stretchy Jersey knit I had to ignore the alignment lines and measure the arm hole and the sleeve edge and align the centers, the yokes etc. changed shape during sewing.</li>
        <li>pin epaulets to outside of shirt with open end of epaulet on shirt/sleeve seam and closed end near collar. Center the epaulet on shoulder line just marked.<br>
          <em>If mark is missing:&nbsp; </em>Front edge of epaulet is 5/8" back from front-yoke seam, collar end is more like 7/8" back, IE angled slightly back from front-yoke seam. </li>
        <li>lay sleeve on shirt rightsides together and the open end of the sleeve near the shirt center, and pin through shirt, sleeve, and epaulet at&nbsp; shoulder line marking.</li>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">pin from the center to the edges. I always get about a 1/2" excess sleeve over arm hole and that excess needs to be about evenly split at the armhole ends else sewing the sides is troublesome.<br>
            My first attempt with the Jersey knit had way more excess than that, I had to rip out the seams and do it over. <br>
          </span>Ignore alignment marks from patterns and pin sleeve to shirt at the ends (what will be the side seam of the shirt) and work any excess up to the back edge of the epaulet and tuck/fold it there.</li>
        <li>sew around the arm openings.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>sides</li>
      <ol>
        <li>pull sleeves out so that shirt is fully inside-out.</li>
        <li>sew from the opening in the sleeve down the sleeve then down the body of the shirt. Use a serger if you have one.<br>
          (Perhaps those without a serger should baste the seam then let someone at Scare serge them later, we want our actors comfortable).</li>
      </ol>
      <li>hem</li>
      <ol>
        <li>if you didn't hem the sleeves before sewing them on then do so now. </li>
        <li>hem the bottom edge of the shirt, roll it if you have the sewing machine foot for doing so, use a serger instead of rolling if you have one.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>buttonholes and finishing</li>
      <ol>
        <li>If the epaulets and pocket flaps are "real" you will have added their buttonholes long ago, just after turning them.</li>
        <li>What is left to do is the button holes in the left front side. I hate buttonholes, you are on your own here. <br>
          If your sewing machine has a buttonhole attachment or mode try it out on the bottom edge of the shirt.</li>
        <li>If the fabric is flimsy cut half inch circles of interface to put inside the shirt at each button position, so that the button threads do not cut through the fabric in use.<br>
          You also might have to do this for the buttonholes as well, a rounded corner rectangle about a half inch wide and 3/8" longer than the button hole (an 1/8th past the ends of the stitching).<br>
          <br>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>

    <h3>Long sleeve variation</h3>
    <p>The long sleeve uses pieces 8,9, and 10 and not piece 4. Pattern piece 8 is the sleeve proper, 9 is the vent facing for which you could use narrow double fold bias tape if you have a color that works for you, 10 is the cuff.<br>
      Do steps a..f below then step g refers to steps 6&amp;7 which attach and sew the seam of the sleeve. The remaining steps finish the cuff, which has to follow sewing the long seam of the sleeve which in turn is best done after the sleeve is attached to the body of the shirt.<br>
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>cut vent line at wrist</li>
      <li>fold fabric out so that the sides of the cut make a single line</li>
      <li>sew vent facing along stretched out line, inside to inside and match edges</li>
      <li>fold vent facing around the seam just sewn,</li>
      <li>fold in half and either top stitch or stitch in gutter to secure other side of facing.</li>
      <li>straighten out vent, it will probably have a little crease at the top.</li>
      <li>attach sleeve to body of shirt per steps 7 and 8 in the main instructions. You can't attach the cuff until the seam of the sleeve has been sewn.</li>
      <li>attach cuff from one end of vent around to other, rightside to sleeve rightside.<br>
        You will make one dart to get the sleeve to fit into the cuff, about a 1/2" overlap. <em>The model shirt does this wrong</em>, the fold should be on the longer side of the vent and folded towards the vent.<br>
        sew it on.</li>
      <li>Fold along seam and then fold in half exposing the outsides.</li>
      <li>Fold over edge of cuff then topstitch or stitch in the ditch to secure the edge to the sleeve.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Pocket flap alignment</h3>
    For some kits we have marked the pocket flap placement with blue tape. The tape is outside of the nominal pocket, the line that it is sewn on with is the edge of the tape farthest from the neck/shoulder, and the inner edge of the flap should leave the vertical piece of tape just exposed.<br>
    <br>
    If the tape or other marking is missing:<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <table border="1">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Nominal size</td>
          <td>vertical edge of pocket from center of shirt</td>
          <td>horizontal edge down from extreme point of neck</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>42/L</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>others</td>
          <td>size*(1/20) + 3.45</td>
