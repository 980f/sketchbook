    <h2>Burda 6349 shirt, with additions for Scare 2021</h2>
    <p>We vary from the "A" design by having two false pocket flaps instead of one actual pocket. We also add epaulets.<br>
      <br>
      I am going to use "outside" and "inside" instead of "right side" and "wrong side" as there is a lot of left and right in these instructions at critical points.<br>

    <h3>Layout optimizations</h3>
    Since we are making multiple copies we can minimize waste by doing some of the on-fold pieces not on the usual fold. Note: 'using the fold' is done to get the best symmetry possible without a seam along the line of symmetry.<br>
    <br>
    In all but one case (the back) we need two of the on-fold pieces. For those I have doubled the pattern piece so that they can be cut from the normally folded fabric but not lined up on the fold. <br>
    Cut wide. Take the cut pieces and fold them in half along the line of the original "place on fold" part of the pattern piece. Trim the folded pieces to the original pattern outline.<br>
    <br>
    If the interfacing is iron on then it can be cut without the seam allowances. That allows for easier turning of the pieces, and saves on interfacing and the time to trim it after sewing.<br>
    <br>
    The epaulets and pocket flaps require 4 fabric pieces and 2 interfacing pieces each. I folded scraps into 4 layers for cutting the fabric.
    <p>There are photos of a layout that takes 5 feet of 45" fabric for a short sleeved shirt.<br>

    <h3>Sewing</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The epaulets, pocket flaps and collar (but not collar band) can be prepped in parallel. Each set involves</li>
      <ol>
        <li>ironing on the interfacing to the inside of one piece</li>
        <li>sewing the 3 pieces together, fabric outsides touching. </li>
        <li>clipping to 1/4" outside the stitching.</li>
        <li>turning them, make the points nice and sharp using a bamboo skewer or dull #2 pencil or similar poking stick.</li>
        <li>top stitch 3 sides. In all cases the 4th side is embedded in some other seam.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>if the epaulets and pocket flaps are to operate then now is the time to make button holes in them.</li>
      <ol>
      </ol>
      <li>In any order</li>
      <ol>
        <li>collar band</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Attach interface to one piece</li>
          <li>Lay the collar band parts outside to outside sandwiching the collar between them.</li>
          <li>After sewing the collar band must have enough materiel beyond the collar on each side for a button hole to be exposed between the collar edges.</li>
          <li>the sewing must stop a seam allowance before the open edge. If you sew past that you will have to rip out a few stitches later.</li>
          <li>clip and turn.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>sew the pocket flaps to the shirt fronts</li>
        <ol>
          <li>outer face (in case one is prettier) is against outside of shirt and flipped up, wavy/bottom edge near the neck.</li>
          <li>sew along line transferred from pattern </li>
          <li>fold down into "closed" position and topstitch below the seam just sewn.</li>
        </ol>
        <ol>
        </ol>
      </ol>
      <li>yoke to back and fronts</li>
      <ol>
        <li>sandwich top of back between yoke pieces, yoke pieces outside to the back. You will have to pin this as the top of the back is curved where the yoke is straight. This keeps the shirt from puckering out behind the shoulders, the back of the shirt will take on a curve in this step.</li>
        <li>sew the yokes to the back.</li>
        <li>fold the seam just sewn so that you can lay the fronts' outside to the back and yoke's outsides.</li>
        <li>sew the shirt front just to the yoke piece on the outside of the back, outsides to outsides.</li>
        <li>open up so that the shirt makes a Y, inside up</li>
        <li>fold the other yoke piece, the one that faced the inside of the back, over the combined yoke and front piece, folding the edge of the yoke to line up with the seam just sewn.</li>
        <li>topstitch or stitch in ditch to catch the inside yoke.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>attaching collar</li>
      <ol>
        <li>starting at the center of the neck pin just what will be the outer layer of the collar band to the outside of the back and yokes.</li>
        <li>When you get to the center edge of the shirt you fold that center edge twice such that it fits into the collar band. <br>
          THIS IS THE TRICKIEST PART. If you fold the center edge of the fronts according to the pattern it is unlikely to match the collar band. <br>
          Wait until this step then measure from the outside of the collar band to the center edge of each front, then cut that number in half and fold the shirt inside to inside by that amount twice. <br>
          IF the fabric does not have distinct inside and outside then you can do the folds to the outside, I personally prefer that appearance. </li>
        <li>Top stitch the center fronts inside of the edge of the fold, make sure you don't catch the collar band.</li>
        <li>Stitch the collar band to the shirt body.</li>
        <li>fold the collar up into its normal position</li>
        <li>fold the remaining inside of the collar edge of the collar band to the shirt. <br>
          Some people hand baste this edge.<br>
          Some people tuck the raw edge into some bias tape and sew that on "in the gutter". "In the gutter" means sewing over an existing seam to catch something placed beneath it.<br>
          I short the seam allowance when sewing the prior step so that I can roll over the edge of the inner part of the collar band then sew in the gutter capturing the rolled edge.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>attaching sleeves (nothing special other than placing the epaulet)</li>
      <ol>
        <li>I wait to hem sleeves until after I sew them on in case I screw up sewing them on. If you are good at sleeves hemming them now is convenient.</li>
        <li>transfer lines marked "shoulder" from yoke pattern to shirt.</li>
        <li>pin epaulets to outside of shirt with open end of epaulet on shirt/sleeve seam and closed end near collar. Center the epaulet on shoulder line just marked.</li>
        <li>lay sleeve on shirt outside to outside and the open end of the sleeve near the shirt center, and pin through shirt, sleeve, and epaulet at&nbsp; shoulder line marking.</li>
        <li>Fold shirt over the sleeve, the body will be inside-out the sleeve will be outside out but poked into the body of the shirt.</li>
        <li>sew around the arm openings.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>sides</li>
      <ol>
        <li>pull sleeves to the outside of shirt body. The shirt should now be fully inside out but looking like a shirt.</li>
        <li>sew from the opening in the sleeve down the sleeve then down the body of the shirt. Use a serger if you have one.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>hem</li>
      <ol>
        <li>if you didn't hem the sleeves before sewing them on then do so now. When convenient I align the sleeve pattern piece such that the selvedge of the fabric is the open edge, no hemming needed or a simple single fold rather than folding twice.</li>
        <li>hem the bottom edge of the shirt, roll it if you have the sewing machine foot for doing so, use a serger instead of rolling if you have one.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>buttonholes and finishing</li>
      <ol>
        <li>If the epaulets and pocket flaps are "real" you will have added their buttonholes long ago, just after turning them.</li>
        <li>What is left to do is the button holes in the left front side. I hate buttonholes, you are on your own here. <br>
          If your sewing machine has a buttonhole attachment or mode try it out on a scrap of fabric before using it on an otherwise finished shirt. <br>
          For this test remember to fold your fabric over to make 3 layers to match the rolled edge of the shirt front.</li>
        <li>If the fabric is flimsy cut half inch circles of interface to put inside the shirt at each button position, so that the button threads do not cut through the fabric in use.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </ol>

    <h3>Long sleeve variation</h3>
    <p>The long sleeve uses pieces 8,9, and 10 and not piece 4. Pattern piece 8 is the sleeve proper, 9 is the vent facing for which you could use narrow double fold bias tape if you have a color that works for you, 10 is the cuff.<br>
      Steps a..f are done, then step g refers to steps 6&amp;7 which attach and sew the seam of the sleeve. The remaining steps finish the cuff, which has to follow sewing the long seam of the sleeve which in turn is best done after the sleeve is attached to the body of the shirt.<br>
    </p>
    <ol type="a">
      <li>cut vent line at wrist</li>
      <li>fold fabric out so that the sides of the cut make a single line</li>
      <li>sew vent facing along stretched out line, inside to inside and match edges</li>
      <li>fold vent facing around the seam just sewn,</li>
      <li>fold in half and either top stitch or stitch in gutter to secure other side of facing.</li>
      <li>straighten out vent, it will probably have a little crease at the top.</li>
      <li>attach sleeve to body of shirt per steps 6 and 7 in the main instructions. You can't attach the cuff until the seam of the sleeve has been sewn.</li>
      <li>attach cuff from one side of vent around to other, insides facing each other.</li>
      <li>Fold along seam and then fold in half exposing the outsides.</li>
      <li>Fold over edge of cuff then topstitch or stitch in the ditch to secure the edge to the sleeve.</li>
