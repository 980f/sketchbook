Big Ben clockface, with wifi programmable hands.

2nd Act starts at 5 a.m. or some similar time. 

Clock should progress at real time, which means we need to know the steps per revolution and the gearing ration from stepper to hands.

Direct drive, 200 steps per rev:
60 minutes/200 steps = 18 seconds per step. Acceleration will not be an issue.

For hour hand we need:
12 hours/200 steps = 216 seconds per step, = minute hand * 12. (just checking).

At such a rate precise timing is not needed so we will not use hardware timers, just software with a catchup.

For slewing we still want to be slow enough to not worry about acceleration.
20 seconds for a complete revolution would be:
20 s/200= 100ms/step.

-------------------
remote control:

) move h|m +|- 1
) declare zero
) run at real time
) goto starting position
) record present location as starting position (if we have index)
if we have time and a trigger:
) step back precomputed jump (for encore)
