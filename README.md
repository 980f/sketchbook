arduino applications

Clone this to be a/your sketchbook.
Each application must have its own directory of the same name as the .ino file it includes.
Each app directory then links to only the files it needs from the shared directory as arduino insists on compiling everything it finds there in. bash script arduous helps with making the links. this only works on an OS with file links.
