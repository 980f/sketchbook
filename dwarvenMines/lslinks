## list lib links of an arduino project,
## when run from arduino project directory,
## which is exactly what we need to ignore when checking for new files

#list files that are links but not directory into a temp file 
find -type l ! -xtype d -printf %f\\n | sort >.lard.1
#merge those into .gitignore via another temp file
cat .gitignore .lard.1 | sort | uniq >.lard.2
cp .lard.2 .gitignore 
#rebuild 'relib' script
echo "## recreate links to library sources" >relib
# if our preferred path to the shared code is named links include that in the rebuild (else see 'newsketch' script)
[ -L "links" ] && [ -d "links" ] && echo "ln -sf $(readlink "links") links" >>relib
#we still have the file of files that are links, we produce a line for each into relib
while read link ; do echo >>relib ln -sf $(readlink "$link") ; done < .lard.1 
chmod a+x relib
#and now kill the temps. Comment this out while investigating/debugging this process.
rm .lard.*

## ps: the name is a typo, it was supposed to be "list arduino library links" but didn't get the nk from links.
