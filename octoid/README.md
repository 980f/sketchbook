octoid is a merger of a highly cleaned up OctoBlaster_TTL and James M's OctoField field programmer for it.

At present it is missing the interface to a programming panel, an I2C version is imminent.

A small effort could look at a jumper to decide whether the device is a unit or a programmer. That way boards can be preprogrammed on the shelf and then installed in either kind of carrier with the carrier jumpered for which end of the link it is.

There is a clone module which with the addition of a button designation would allow one to program another's sample table and other settings.
