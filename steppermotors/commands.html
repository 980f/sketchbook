    <h2>Dual stepper driver with homing capability</h2>
    <p>github/980f/sketchbook&nbsp; steppermotors&nbsp; and shared folders
      required, and shared requires you checkout github/980f/ezcpp beneath it.<br>
      <br>
      Some commands apply to both motors at once, or neither.<br>
      Commands particular to a motor are single letters, and the case of the
      letter picks which motor.<br>
      <br>
      Motion happens via a state machine. <br>
      State transitions are paced by a soft timer programmed in microseconds
      (Arduino micros() function is called in loop() to do timing).<br>
      There is a position and a target. If not homing and they are not the same
      then a step is made in the appropriate direction.<br>
      There is a "free run" flag which ignores position and target and issues
      steps in a selected direction.<br>
      Homing state machine is explained after the table of commands, and
      overrides the above.</p>

    <h3>Spontaneous emissions</h3>
    <p>The program is likely to still have diagnostic messages being output.
      Messages that are part of the protocol are framed with '{' and '}' and
      formatted very similar to JSON. The difference from standard JSON is that
      no quote are emitted around keys and values. Note that all values are
      numerical.<br>
      The protocol messages are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the response to the ' ' command, which is the status of both motor
        state machines. <br>
        "{W:", which, ", T:", target, ", P:", pos, ", FR:", [-1|1|0], ", HM:",
        homing, ", tick:", usec, '}'</li>
      <li>upon reaching a target during normal motion (which includes the final
        step of homing) or if given a motion command and already at that
        location.<br>
        "{W:", which, ",M:", pos, "}"</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <h3>Homing</h3>
    <p><br>
      The H command (which might be internally issued on reset) starts the
      homing sequence. It is presumed that the sensor will be active for many
      steps. The procedure finds both edges of the sensor range and calls the
      average of them '0'.<br>
      Motions occur at 'homeSpeed' which is optionally set by this command.<br>
      The other parameter is 'homeWidth' optionally set by this command, see
      below for usage. Default values for these are set by a command string
      executed by setup().</p>
    Homing begins with an initialization of all state machine controls, present
    state is ignored. <br>
    If the sensor is already active then position and target are set up for a
    forward move to get off of the home position.<br>
    Else position and target are set up for a reverse move.<br>
    <br>
    <sub>Note: in both cases the values are such that the position will change
      sign after 'homeWidth' steps without an edge detected. At the moment that
      does not get checked and sensor failure results in near infinite motion.<br>
      <br>
      Note: if the hardware has been configured to not have a sensor then the
      state machine is set to make the present position 0 and all other values
      set so that no motion occurs without another command.</sub><br>
    <br>
    <p>If moving forward to make the sensor go off then when the off is set the
      same values are set as if the sensor was off when homing began.</p>
    <p>If moving backwards to find the sensor then when it goes on position and
      target are set to continue moving backwards, and so that position goes
      negative if more than homeWidth steps are taken and the sensor is still
      on.</p>
    <p>While continuing to move backwards after having found one edge of the
      sensor then when the sensor goes off we have found the other edge and
      position is set to half the difference between the edges and target is set
      for 0. Homing is marked as done even though the motor will continue to
      move until it gets to 0.</p>
    <p>Motion commands sent while homing will disrupt the homing procedure by
      altering the speed.</p>
    <hr>
    <h3><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Undesirable features</span>
      Quirks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If the steprate ever becomes zero either motion is permanently
        disabled or so fast that nothing actually occurs, as in 100k steps per
        second attempted, which might make the driver chip very hot. Whether 0
        is a lock up can be determined by reading the source code, it is
        deterministic just not obvious.</li>
      <li>hardware pin allocations are burned into the code, not configurable in
        the field. <br>
        This includes whether a home sensor exists for a motor. If there is no
        home sensor but one is configured then don't issue an H command but
        instead send XMZ:
        <ul>
          <li>X sets target to position, which stops motion, and marks
            "successfully homed" so this clears a failed homing request.</li>
          <li>M with no operands sets target to 0</li>
          <li>Z sets position to 0.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        You can then use F or R to start perpetual motion and change speed with
        S. You can stop with X without having to send MZ again, but might as
        well.</li>
